# Recipe: Slow Cooker Apple Butter

Source: http://ohsheglows.com/recipage/?recipe_id=6033152


Ingredients:

- 5.5 lbs of an equal mixture of sweet and tart apples.  More or less is fine.
- Ground cinnamon or other spices like nutmeg, ground cloves, etc, to taste.
- tiny bit of fresh lemon juice, to taste (helps to preserve), optional

Instructions

1. Slice apples. 
2. Set slow cooker on HIGH for 4 hours, covered with lid. During those 4 hours,
   give it a few stirs as the apples tend to stick to the bottom a bit. You can
   add some apple juice or cider to prevent sticking. If you’d rather cook it
   longer on a lower heat, you can do that too.
3. Mash apples and turn off heat. After 4 hours, most of the apples are soft
   enough to mash up with a wooden spoon or potato masher. After mashing, we
   now have applesauce (with the peel of course)!
4. Cool slightly and scoop into high-speed blender. With a big ladle, scoop the
   apple mixture into a blender. If you have a small blender you may have to do
   this in a few batches. Make sure lid is secured tightly.
5. Blend the mixture. Start on a low setting and go faster until you reach max
   speed. You may need to let some steam escape through the top hole if there
   is one. Puree mixture until super smooth and buttery. If it’s still chunky,
   keep blending.
6. Pour the apple butter back into the slow cooker. Turn heat on HIGH and cook
   down, uncovered, for another 45-90 minutes until it’s as thick as you
   desire. Keep in mind it will thicken slightly once chilled overnight.
7. When ready, add cinnamon to taste (or other spices if desired) and a very
   small amount of lemon juice if desired.
8. Cool completely and store in an air-tight jar for up to 1 month in the
   fridge. Or you can try canning it as well.
