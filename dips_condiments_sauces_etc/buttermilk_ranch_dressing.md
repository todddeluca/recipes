Servings: Makes about 1-1/3 cups

Ingredients:

- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1/2 cup buttermilk
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise, best quality such as Hellmann's or Duke's
- 2 garlic cloves, minced (see note)
- 1 scant teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 1-1/2 teaspoons dried dill
- 1/4 cup finely chopped fresh chives
- 2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
- Few dashes Tabasco sauce, optional

Instructions:

Combine all of the ingredients in a medium bowl and whisk well. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Chill until ready to serve.

Note: The dressing will keep well in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. The garlic flavor gets stronger the longer it sits, so you might want to cut back if you're planning on making it in advance. The dressing will thicken up to more of a dip consistency as it chills.
