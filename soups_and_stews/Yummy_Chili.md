Ingredients:

- 1 Tbsp oil	
- 1 large onion, diced 				
- 2 or 3 larges cloves garlic, minced				
- 4 carrots, chopped
- 2 red bell peppers, chopped				
- 1.5 lbs ground turkey						
- 3 (15 oz) cans black beans, drained				
- 1 (14.5 oz) can crushed tomatoes
- 1 can plain corn (or frozen)
- 1 Tsp chili (or more to taste)
- 1 Tbsp dried oregano
- 1 Tbsp dried basil
- 1 Tbsp red wine vinegar
- 1/2 to 1 Tbsp cumin
- 1 chipotle pepper in Adobe sauce
- 2 Tbsp of Adobe sauce

Directions:

1.	Heat oil in large heavy pot over medium heat. Cook onions for 2-3 minutes,
    then add garlic and cook until translucent. (Add more oil if needed.) Then
    add carrots and red pepper and sauté for a few minutes.
2.	Add chili powder and cumin and sauté briefly.
3.	Add ground turkey and cook, stirring, until the meat is brown.
4.	Stir in tomatoes, oregano, basil, red wine vinegar, and beans. Bring to a
    boil, then simmer covered 30 minutes and uncovered 30 minutes. Add corn for
    the last 30 minutes
5.	Make mix to put on top of chili: mix together: 1/2 onion finely diced,
    1/2-1 lime juiced, 1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped, and 1 ripe avocado,
    diced to medium size.
6.	Can accompany with: grated cheddar, sour cream, fresh chopped cilantro, and
    chopped green onion.

Notes: 

1.	If you like lots of onion and garlic, amount can be increased. 
2.	Also can use 2 cans black beans and 1 can of pinto beans with jalapeño. 
3.	Great served with corn bread. 
4.	For vegetarian version, just omit turkey.
