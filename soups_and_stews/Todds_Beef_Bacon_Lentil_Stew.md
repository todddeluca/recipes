# Recipe: Todd's Beef Bacon Lentil Stew

Comments: Made it with 2.5 Quarts chicken stock, which is too much.  To avoid overcooking them, ideally the
lentils would be added after the meat had cooked awhile.  It could use more
spicing.  It is tasty but plain.

Ingredients:

1-2 lbs cubed stew meat.
2 large vidalia (sweet) onions, chopped.
2 cloves garlic, chopped.
1 Tbsp butter
8 carrots, chopped.
4 potatoes or sweet potatoes, chopped.
3 slices bacon
2 cups lentils
2 quarts homemade chicken stock.
12 oz. stout beer
1 tsp (or less) kosher sea salt ;-)
1 tbsp worchestershire sauce
2 bay leaves

Pressure Cooker Preparation:

Brown the beef cubes in a beautiful cast-iron pan.  Put them into the 8-quart
pressure cooker pot.  Saute the onions and garlic in the butter and add it to
the pot.  Fry the bacon until crispy and add it to the pot.  Sizzle the lentils
in the bacon grease and add them to the pot.  Add the remaining ingredients to
the pot, close it up, bring the pot up to pressure, and cook for 12 minutes.
Then turn off the heat and let the pot depressurize on its own.
