http://bevcooks.com/2013/08/thai-coconut-corn-and-mushroom-soup/

Ingredients:

- 2 Tbs. Thai red curry paste
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 (14 oz) can coconut milk
- 1 1/2 cups chicken stock
- 4 ears sweet corn, kernels removed
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced into small strips
- 8 oz baby bella mushrooms, lightly rinsed and sliced
- 4 cups baby spinach
- juice of 1-2 limes (to taste)
- 1/2 tsp fish sauce (don’t be scared)
- coarse salt and freshly ground pepper
- 1/2 cup cilantro leaves, plus more for garnish
- 2 Thai bird chiles, thinly sliced (optional, for garnish)

Directions:

Place a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the curry paste and press it into
the pot, releasing the oils. Do this for about a minute. Add the garlic and 1/3
cup coconut milk and stir to combine and bloom and become fragrant. Oh yes.

Then add the rest of the coconut milk and chicken stock. As it gets warmer,
taste it. Add as much salt and pepper as you need to bring out the good
flavors. A few little pinches.

Then add the corn, red bell pepper and mushrooms. Let simmer about 5 minutes,
until everything is heated through. Add the spinach to wilt. Taste it. Almost
there.

Take it off the heat and squeeze in a good Tbs. or two of lime juice, along
with the fish sauce. Stir and taste. Like it? Oh yeah. Add the cilantro and
maybe one last pinch of salt if needed.

Serve garnished with cilantro and sliced Thai bird chiles. And more lime
wedges! I’m obsessed with lime.
