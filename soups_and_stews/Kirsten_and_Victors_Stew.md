# Kirsten and Victor's Stew


# Directions

1. Cook bacon well, then dice finely.
2. Cook onions until translucent in some of the bacon fat (or just use oil), saving the rest of the fat.
3. Brown meat (like lamb, beef, chicken, ...) and flour.  Watch the heat.  Don't let the flour burn.  The flour needs to cook in the fat.  1 lb meat to 1 heaping Tbsp flour.
4. Deglaze the bottom with liquid, e.g. red wine and chicken stock, or try beer, cider, stock, water, etc.
5. Add tomato paste or diced tomatoes (either fresh or canned).
6. Add chopped carrots and potatoes.
7. Lock and load your pressure cooker.  Bring to pressure and cook 10-15 minutes.
8. Add green vegetables (frozen peas, green beans, etc.) and cook until done.
9. Enjoy.  It is even better the next day.
