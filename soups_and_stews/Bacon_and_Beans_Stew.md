# Bacon and Beans Stew

There is a nice balance of flavors in this stew.  I was surprised by how much liquid the tomatoes provide.  The spaghetti squash worked well, breaking into short strands and filling with flavor.  Haidee liked this even more than the borscht.

Ingredients:

- 1/2 lb bacon, chopped
- 1-2 cups dried black-eyed peas, presoaked
- 1/2 grilled chicken breast, chopped
- 1 Spaghetti Squash, skinned, gutted, and chopped
- 2 jalape√±os, chopped
- 2 onions, chopped
- 8 tomatoes, sliced
- 1/2 small can of tomato paste
- 2 sprigs oregano
- 4 springs thyme
- 1 Tbsp white wine vinegar
- salt
- pepper

Directions:

Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.  Brown the bacon in a dutch oven.  Add the rest of the ingredients to the dutch oven, stir well and cook for 60-90 minutes, stirring once or twice if you simply must.
