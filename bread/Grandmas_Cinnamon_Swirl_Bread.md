# Grandma Roumagoux's Cinnamon Swirl Bread

Ingredients:

- 1pkg or 3 t Active dry yeast OR 1 cake compressed yeast  15g
- ¼ c water.  60g.
- 2 c milk, scalded.  490g.
- ½ c sugar  115g
- ½ c butter or coconut oil (originally called for shortening)  110g.
- 2 t salt  15g
- 7½ to 8 c sifted enriched flour (can use 1/2 whole wheat flour).  640g white flour, 600g white whole wheat
- 2 eggs
- 1.5 c sugar mixed with 3 T cinnamon (originally was 3/4 c sugar, 1.5 T cinnamon)

Directions:

Soften yeast in warm water or compressed yeast in luke-warm water.  Set aside

In a bowl, place the sugar, shortening, and salt.  Pour in scalded milk and stir to dissolve the sugar.  Cool to luke-warm.  

Add 3 c flour and mix well.  Stir in yeast and eggs.  Beat well.

Add remaining flour or enough to make a soft dough.

Turn out on a floured surface.  Cover and rest 10 minutes.

Knead until smooth and elastic, approximately 8 – 10 minutes.

Place in a lightly greased bowl, turning once to grease the entire surface of the dough.  Cover and let rise in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, approximately 1½ – 2 hours.  

Punch down and let rise until the dough has doubled, approximately 1 hour.

Punch down and divide the dough in half.  Cover and rest for 10 minutes.

Roll each half into a 15” x 7” rectangle, approximately ½” thick.

Reserve 2 T cinnamon sugar.


Sprinkle the rest over the rectangles of dough.  Sprinkle approximately 2 t of water over the dough and smooth with a spatula.

Roll each rectangle, as you would for a jelly roll, starting with the short side.  Seal the long edge when finished.  

Grease 2 - 9½” x 5” x 3” loaf pans.  Place the dough, sealed edge down, in each pan.

Let rise until the dough has doubled, approximately 45 – 60 minutes.  

Just before baking, brush the loaves with soft butter and sprinkle with the remaining cinnamon sugar.  

Preheat oven to 375º.  Bake for 35 – 40 minutes or until done.  

Turn out of pans and cool on a rack.  

NOTE: If the crusts brown too quickly, cover with tin foil for the last 5 – 10 minutes in the oven.
